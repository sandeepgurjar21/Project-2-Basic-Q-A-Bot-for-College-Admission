# Project-2-Basic-Q-A-Bot-for-College-Admission

Implementation Steps: Develop Q&A Responses:

Gather information about college admission procedures, requirements, and deadlines. Implement a function to respond to these queries. User Interaction Flow:

Design a conversation flow for admission-related queries. Allow the user to ask multiple questions in one session. Contextual Understanding:

Enhance the chatbot's context-awareness by storing user information from previous interactions. Implement personalized responses based on stored information. Connect to Backend :

Integrate the chatbot with a backend to fetch real-time information. Ensure accurate and up-to-date responses. Error Handling and Feedback:

Implement robust error handling for unrecognized queries. Provide users with helpful feedback when their queries cannot be addressed. Expanded Example Code (Python):

Example Backend Server (Flask) Create a simple Flask server that serves admission-related information:(using app,py)

Chatbot with Backend Connection Modify the chatbot to fetch information from the backend server:(using chatbot.py)

Steps to Run the Backend and Chatbot: Run the Flask Server:

Save the Flask server code in a file named app.py. Run the server by executing python app.py in your terminal. The server will start at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Run the Chatbot:

Save the chatbot code in a separate Python file.(chatbot.py) Run the chatbot code, which will fetch real-time information from the running Flask server. This setup will allow the chatbot to fetch real-time admission-related information from a backend server, ensuring that responses are up-to-date and accurate.
